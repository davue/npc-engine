//! This is the utility module of the [NPC engine](https://crates.io/crates/npc-engine-core/), containing helpful utility code.
//!
//! It contains the following features:
//! - A helper trait [OptionDiffDomain] that can be used when [Diffs](Domain::Diff) are just copies of the [State](Domain::State).
//! - Two executors (update loops), [SimpleExecutor] and [ThreadedExecutor], that implement the execution logic of a [Domain] beyond planning itself, and related abstractions.
//! - A simple implementation of feed-forward leaky ReLU neurons ([Neuron]) and corresponding simple networks ([NeuralNetwork]), providing learning based on back-propagation ([NeuralNetwork::train]).
//! - Simple 2-D coordinates ([Coord2D]) and direction ([Direction]) implementations.
//! - Helper functions to plot search trees: [plot_tree_in_tmp] and [plot_tree_in_tmp_with_task_name].
//! - Helper functions to simplify functional programming with tuples: [keep_first] and [keep_second], and their mutable versions [keep_first_mut] and [keep_second_mut].
